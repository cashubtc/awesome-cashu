# Awesome Cashu ðŸ¥œâœ¨

A curated, collaborative list of awesome resources for getting ramped up with Cashu

## What's Cashu?

Cashu is a free and open-source Chaumian Ecash system built for Bitcoin. [Chaumian Ecash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecash) is an anonymous cryptographic electronic money or electronic cash system invented in 1982. Cashu is a modern ecash implementation on Bitcoin.

Visit [cashu.space](https://cashu.space/) or [docs.cashu.space](https://docs.cashu.space/) to learn more.

## The Cashu protocol

Cashu is an open Ecash protocol for anyone to implement. The specifications, called [Cashu NUTs](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts) (Notation, Usage, and Terminology) describe how to implement the protocol. Multiple Cashu client libaries make it easy for developers to write their own wallets.
